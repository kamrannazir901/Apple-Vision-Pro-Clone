This is a clone of the Apple Vision Pro webpage (https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/), created to showcase my skills in front-end development. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including GSAP and ScrollTrigger) to replicate the look and feel of the Apple Vision Pro page.

## Features:
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts seamlessly for different screen sizes. [Desktop and (max-width:1000px)]
- **Canvas Animation:** JavaScript is used to render images on a canvas based on the scroll trigger, creating smooth transitions and effects as the user scrolls.
- **Scroll-triggered Effects:** GSAP and ScrollTrigger are used to create smooth animations as the user scrolls through the page.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Applied DOM concepts to interact with the page elements and implement dynamic features.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GSAP
- ScrollTrigger
- Canvas

## How to View the Project:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
