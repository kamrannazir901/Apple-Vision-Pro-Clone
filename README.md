This is a clone of the Apple Vision Pro webpage (https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/), created to showcase my skills in front-end development. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including GSAP and ScrollTrigger) to replicate the look and feel of the Apple Vision Pro page.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML

Feel free to explore or use it for learning and inspiration.
